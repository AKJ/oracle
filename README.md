# Oracle:
## MUSHclient add-ons to improve accessibility for Achaea

Oracle is a set of [MUSHclient](https://www.mushclient.com/) plugins and scripts to increase the accessibility and playability of [Achaea: Dreams of Divine Lands.](https://achaea.com/) The aim of this project is to recreate some of the more popular Mudlet scripts that exist so they are usable by blind players.
